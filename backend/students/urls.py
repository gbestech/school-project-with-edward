# Custom Actions (from @action decorators):
# - GET    /students/current_schedule/           -> current_schedule (for logged-in student)
# - GET    /students/{id}/schedule/              -> schedule (specific student's complete schedule)
# - GET    /students/{id}/weekly_schedule/       -> weekly_schedule (weekly view)
# - GET    /students/{id}/daily_schedule/        -> daily_schedule (daily view, supports ?date=YYYY-MM-DD)
# - GET    /students/{id}/studentschedule/       -> studentschedule (legacy endpoint)

# Schedule-related endpoints:

# 1. For current logged-in student:
#    GET /api/my-schedule/                    -> Function-based view (student_schedule_view)
#    GET /api/students/current_schedule/      -> ViewSet action (current_schedule)
#    GET /api/students/dashboard/             -> Dashboard with schedule summary
#    GET /api/students/profile/               -> Profile information

# 2. For specific student (by ID):
#    GET /api/students/123/schedule/          -> Complete schedule
#    GET /api/students/123/weekly_schedule/   -> Weekly grouped view
#    GET /api/students/123/daily_schedule/    -> Today's schedule
#    GET /api/students/123/daily_schedule/?date=2024-03-15  -> Specific date

# 3. Student management:
#    GET /api/students/                       -> List all students
#    POST /api/students/                      -> Create new student
#    GET /api/students/123/                   -> Get specific student details
#    PATCH /api/students/123/                 -> Update student
#    DELETE /api/students/123/                -> Delete student

# 4. Statistics and filtering:
#    GET /api/students/nursery_students/      -> All nursery students
#    GET /api/students/student_statistics/    -> Overall statistics
#    GET /api/students/?education_level=NURSERY  -> Filter by education level
#    GET /api/students/?search=John           -> Search students
