	My name is Alimat. I am in primary 2. My hubby is reading. I love reading story books,  magazines and any kind of material that I find interesting.
	I started reading when I was a little girl. My mother always read fairytales and other bed time stories to me. Later she got tired of reading to me. As soon as I could, I learnt to read. I started with A B C. Now I can read, and I read anything that is available. Reading has helped me a lot. I have learnt so many things about people, their customs and their ways of life.
	I learnt about how  many people lived in the ancient days of magic and mystery.
Through reading, I don't have to learn the hard way. I know about dangerous diseases to avoid. I know about dangerous animals to avoid and also know how to stay healthy and alive.
